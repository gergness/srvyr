# srvyr

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gergness/srvyr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gergness/srvyr)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/gergness/srvyr/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/gergness/srvyr?branch=master)

srvyr brings parts of [dplyr's](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/) syntax to survey
analysis, using the [survey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html) 
package.

srvyr focuses on calculating summary statistics from survey data, such as the
mean, total or quantile. It allows for the use of  many dplyr verbs, such as
`summarize`, `group_by`, and `mutate`, the convenience of pipe-able functions,
lazyeval's style of non-standard evaluation and more consistent return types
than the survey package.

You can try it out (only available on github at the moment):

```R
devtools::install_github("gergness/srvyr")
```

To create a `tbl_svy` object (the core concept behind the srvyr package), 
use the function `as_survey_design()` with the bare column names of the names
you would use in `survey::svydesign()` object.

```R 
library(survey)
data(api)

dstrata <- apistrat %>%
   as_survey_design(strata = stype, weights = pw)
```

Now many of the dplyr verbs are available.

* Use `mutate()` if you want to add or modify a variable.
```R
dstrata <- dstrata %>%
  mutate(api_diff = api00 - api99)
```

* `summarise()` calculates summary statistics such as mean, total, quantile or ratio.
```R
dstrata %>% 
  summarise(api_diff = survey_mean(api_diff, vartype = "ci")))
```

* Use `group_by()` if you want to summarise by groups.
```R
dstrata %>% 
  group_by(stype) %>%
  summarise(api_diff = survey_mean(api_diff, vartype = "ci")))
```

You can still use functions from the survey package if you'd like to:
```R
svyglm(api99 ~ stype, dstrata)
```

If you'd like to contribute, please let me know! I started this as a way to learn
about R package development, so you'll have to bear with me as I learn, but I would
appreciate bug reports, pull requests or other suggestions!
