srvyr brings parts of [dplyr's](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/) syntax to survey
analysis, using the [survey](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survey) 
package.

srvyr focuses on calculating summary statistics from survey data, such as the
mean, total or quantile. It allows for the use of many dplyr verbs, such as
`summarize`, `group_by`, and `mutate`, the convenience of pipe-able functions,
rlang's style of non-standard evaluation and more consistent return types
than the survey package.

You can try it out:

```R
install.packages("srvyr")
# or for development version
# remotes::install_github("gergness/srvyr")
```

## Example usage

First, describe the variables that define the survey's structure with the function
`as_survey()`with the bare column names of the names that you would use in functions
from the survey package like `survey::svydesign()`, `survey::svrepdesign()` or 
`survey::twophase()`.

```{r}
library(srvyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
data(api, package = "survey")

dstrata <- apistrat %>%
   as_survey_design(strata = stype, weights = pw)
```

Now many of the dplyr verbs are available.

* `mutate()` adds or modifies a variable.
```{r}
dstrata <- dstrata %>%
  mutate(api_diff = api00 - api99)
```

* `summarise()` calculates summary statistics such as mean, total, quantile or ratio.
```{r}
dstrata %>% 
  summarise(api_diff = survey_mean(api_diff, vartype = "ci"))
```

* `group_by()` and then `summarise()` creates summaries by groups.
```{r}
dstrata %>% 
  group_by(stype) %>%
  summarise(api_diff = survey_mean(api_diff, vartype = "ci"))
```

* Functions from the survey package are still available:
```{r}
my_model <- survey::svyglm(api99 ~ stype, dstrata)
summary(my_model)
```

**Still need help?**

I think the best way to get help is to form a specific question and ask it in some place like [posit's community website](https://forum.posit.co/) (known for it's friendly community) or [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com) (maybe not known for being quite as friendly, but probably has more people). If you think you've found a bug in srvyr's code, please file an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gergness/srvyr/issues/new), but note that I'm not a great resource for helping specific issue, both because I have limited capacity but also because I do not consider myself an expert in the statistical methods behind survey analysis.

**Have something to add?**

These resources were mostly found via vanity searches on twitter & github. If you know of anything I missed, or have written something yourself, [please let me know in this GitHub issue](<https://github.com/gergness/srvyr/issues/127>)!
